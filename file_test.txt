Did you stdout there all alone?
Oh, I can explain what's goin' at libft
I can see you stdin' next to me
In and out somewhere else right now
You sigh, look away
I can see it clear as day
Close your eyes, so afraid
Hide behind that baby face
Do-do-do
You can drive all night
Lookin' for the answers in the pointer rain
You wanna find peace of mind
Lookin' for the answer
Funny how it seems like yesterday
As I made system call, you were lookin' out of place
Gathered up your things and slipped away
No time at all, I followed you into the hall
Cigarette daydream
You were only seventeen
Soft speak as a fucking manual
